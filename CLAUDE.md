# Trajectory — Claude Code Context

Read this first in every session. Then `BRAINSTORM.md` (design decisions), `DECISIONS.md` (grilling outcomes), and `ROADMAP.md` (milestones). `FUTURE.md` lists out-of-scope ideas.

## What it is

A self-hosted, multi-user, web-based workout tracker for strength + cardio. Single shared gym (multi-gym supported in schema and UI for travel). Two users: Johnny + Alina. Self-hosted on a public HTTPS domain.

The differentiator is **equipment-first** data modeling: the user's specific gym and its specific machines are the primary objects, not a generic exercise library. Reflects the reality that 99% of training happens at the same gym; people walk up to "the cable row near the mirror," not to "seated cable row" as an abstract exercise.

## Stack

- **SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 + TypeScript** — web framework.
- **Drizzle ORM + better-sqlite3 + SQLite** — persistence. Single DB file at `data/db.sqlite`.
- **Better Auth** — username/password, session cookies. Two seeded users via env var on first run.
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — styling. Design tokens in `src/lib/theme.css`.
- **`@vite-pwa/sveltekit`** — PWA (service worker, manifest, offline cache).
- **`sharp`** — image resize for equipment photos.
- **Single Docker container** — Node 22 alpine. `docker compose up` is the only command to bring up dev. Host bind mounts for `data/db.sqlite` and `data/uploads/`.

## MVP scope (v0.1)

The app must do exactly the following:

1. Set up your gym(s): add equipment (name, photo, type, default exercise).
2. Two users with separate accounts and separate sessions/sets. Equipment is shared across users (gym-wide, not per-user).
3. Log a set: tap equipment → adjust weight via stepper → adjust reps/sets → save.
4. Pre-fill last-used values per user × exercise.
5. Session view: see what's been logged in the current session. Sessions form implicitly: a 90-min gap since the last set starts a new session; 6h gap auto-closes the open one.
6. History view: 12-week heatmap, list of past sessions, drill into any session.
7. One progression chart per equipment (top set over time). Plus muscle-group distribution + per-machine sparkline list on Stats.
8. CSV export of all data.

Cardio is in scope. Templates per cardio kind (treadmill / bike / rower / generic). See BRAINSTORM.md Q7 for exact field set.

Anything not in the above list lives in `FUTURE.md`. Resist scope creep.

## How to run locally

```bash
docker compose up
# → http://localhost:5173
```

That's it. First boot creates `data/db.sqlite`, runs migrations, and seeds users from `SEED_USERS` env var.

Required env vars (set in `.env` at repo root, gitignored):

```
SEED_USERS=johnny:initialpw,alina:initialpw   # only consumed if user table is empty
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<random 32-char string>
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173         # for absolute URLs in PWA manifest
```

For production, additionally:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-trajectory-domain
```

Hot reload works inside the container via Vite + chokidar polling. Editing any `src/*` file triggers an HMR update without container restart.

## How to deploy

Trajectory is hosted on a **public HTTPS domain** (per D7). This is non-negotiable: iOS Safari requires HTTPS for full PWA install, and Better Auth needs HTTPS for secure cookies.

Deployment shape:
- Reverse proxy (Caddy / Traefik / Nginx) terminates TLS, forwards to the container on port 5173.
- Container runs as `node build` after `pnpm build` (prod target in Dockerfile).
- `data/` directory bind-mounted to a persistent host path (e.g. `/srv/trajectory/data`).
- Container restart policy: `unless-stopped`.
- Migrations apply automatically on container boot (per D9). Pre-migration snapshot at `data/db.sqlite.pre-migration-<ISO timestamp>`.

## Backup

**Always use SQLite's `.backup` API, never `cp`** (per D6 — `cp` of a live file can copy a torn page).

```bash
docker exec trajectory sqlite3 /app/data/db.sqlite ".backup /app/data/backup-$(date -Iseconds).sqlite"
```

For automated backups, schedule that command via cron on the host. Restic / borg / rsync of the entire `data/` directory is FUTURE.

## Conventions

- **No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer in commits or PRs.** Ever. Saved as a global preference.
- **Branches per milestone:** `m4-setup-screen`, etc. Merge to `main` on milestone close.
- **Commit style:** small, frequent, present-tense imperative ("add equipment glyph chooser"). Conventional Commits prefix optional but encouraged (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- **Schema changes always via Drizzle migrations.** Never hand-edit an applied migration file. Run `pnpm db:generate` after schema changes; commit the generated SQL.
- **Photos go to `data/uploads/`**, never into the repo.
- **Per-milestone push gate (mandatory):** before any push that closes a milestone:
  1. `docker compose up` from clean. Tail logs. Confirm no errors, no missing-env warnings, migrations clean.
  2. Connect via **chrome-devtools MCP**, take screenshots, check console for errors.
  3. Smoke-test every "Done when" bullet by clicking through the actual UI.
  4. Smoke-test one obvious adjacent edge case.
  5. If anything fails, fix and re-run from step 1.
  6. Only then commit + push.

  This is non-negotiable. See `ROADMAP.md` cross-milestone conventions and the persistent feedback memory for the full rule.

- **No scope cuts framed as "saves N days."** Build effort isn't the user's cost. Cuts must justify themselves on maintenance / validation / lock-in grounds, not calendar.

## Common gotchas

- **`equipment` is shared, sessions/sets are per-user.** Don't add `userId` to `equipment` — see Q1 in BRAINSTORM.md.
- **All sets FK to an `exercise`, even on machines.** Machines auto-create one hidden exercise (`isHidden=true`) so the FK chain is uniform.
- **`session.gymId` is captured at first set, immutable after.** If you need to model a "wrong gym" fix, that's a manual DB action for v0.1.
- **`set.extras` is JSON.** Schema doesn't enforce keys — the UI does. Don't try to add per-extra columns; that's how you get 30-column tables full of nulls.
- **ULIDs are client-generated.** Server validates format on every mutation. Assume malformed IDs are the most common bug class to defend against.
- **Soft-delete via `deletedAt`** on equipment, exercise, set. Every read query needs `WHERE deletedAt IS NULL`. Use the helper layer in `src/lib/server/db/`; don't write raw queries that forget this.
- **Renaming preserves history; delete-and-recreate doesn't.** Setup must offer edit-in-place (per D5). Deleting equipment with logged sets requires confirmation.

## Pointers

- `BRAINSTORM.md` — every design decision and the option chosen.
- `DECISIONS.md` — every adversarial pressure point and the surviving decision.
- `ROADMAP.md` — M1 through M12 with explicit Done criteria.
- `FUTURE.md` — every idea deliberately deferred.
- `handoff/trajectory/project/` — original React/JSX design prototype. Read it for visual reference; do not port code line-by-line.
